# Dual Hue Color Detection with OpenCV

This project implements a color detection system using OpenCV that can detect a specific color (red) in real-time from a video feed. The detection uses two HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges to handle the hue wraparound characteristic of red color in the HSV color space.

## Features

- Real-time color detection using a webcam.
- Dual hue handling for improved accuracy in detecting red.
- Bounding box drawing around detected color regions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pillow
